# unknown_pleasures_plot
Jupyter notebook with code and visualization plot of the cover of Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures (1979) using Python/Matplotlib

The iconic cover shows the oscillation signal coming from the Pulsar PSR B1919+21 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1919%2B21

The data used in this script was found in https://gist.githubusercontent.com/borgar/31c1e476b8e92a11d7e9/raw/0fae97dab6830ecee185a63c1cee0008f6778ff6/pulsar.csv
